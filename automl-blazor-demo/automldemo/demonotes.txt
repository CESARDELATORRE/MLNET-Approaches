Machine learning is hard and not accessible to majority of .NET developers. 

With the demo for AutoML and ML.NET we are going to show you next we aim to make ML accessible to .NET developers. 

So, Imagine this ecommerce ASP.NET web site which allows a user to provide feedback. 

Let’s go ahead and enhance this experience using Machine Learning to improve customer experience.

We have classified customer reviews as positive/ negative. Let us explore the data and explain the columns.

.NET CLI is used by ~2M developers to build their applications. We have extended the .NET CLI to add ML capabilities using AutoML. 
Let us show you this experience.

mlnet new --ml-task binary-classification --dataset "customer-reviews.tsv" --label-column-name Sentiment

Highlight the task and label.

AutoML is searching for the best model. Currently this is running locally. In the future we will use Azure Machine Learning for training, deployment and more.

At the end of the process, AutoML gave me the best model and the code to consume the model.

Add model to app. Highlight code and happiness scale.

lets run the app


Machine learning is awful

Machine learning is exciting with ML.NET
